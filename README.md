# CNNDescent
CNNDescent is a C implementation of the NN-Descent algorithm for building and running queries on (approximate) k-nearest neighbor graphs efficiently (as described by Dong et al. 2011), with an emphasis on optimizing memory consumption and training time.
CNNDescent provides python bindings (generated by [SIP](https://github.com/Python-SIP/sip)), and is also usable from C and C++.
## Installation
### Python package (through pip)
The cnndescent python module can be installed through pip:

```sh
pip install cnndescent
```

### C/C++ library

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MariosAchilias/CNNDescent.git
cd CNNDescent/clib
Make
```

To use C library, include ``include/knngraph.h``. A simple C++ wrapper is provided in ``include/cnndescent.hpp`` and should be used if C compatibility is not required (provides more intuitive interface and error handling).
